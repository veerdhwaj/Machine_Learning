# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This is the code for the Twitter Sentiment Analyzer. Instead of printing out each tweet,we are here saving each Tweet to a CSV file with an associated label. The label should be either 'Positive' or 'Negative'.


##Dependencies

tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/)
textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
Install missing dependencies using pip

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via

python demo.py

The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet.
